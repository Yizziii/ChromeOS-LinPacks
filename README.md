# LinPacks
Hey! welcome to the LinPacks GitHub Repo! (LPGR)
This script can install Wine, Apk-Installing Support, and Flatpak Support!

## Warning!
For Apk's, You must go to your linux settings and enable ADB debugging.

## What do I run in my terminal to start?
To run the LinPacks Install. you must run these commands below;
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
Then after that, make it install the repo's sh command and run it!
```
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yizziii/ChromeOS-LinPacks/main/LinPacks.sh)
```
Now i dont have any contact info but if it doesnt work try debugging it yourself to see what works!
